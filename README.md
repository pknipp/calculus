Developed from https://dev.to/xinnks/deploy-a-rust-website-on-heroku-1l45

To do:
* handle divergences appropriately
* flesh out readme
* perform char replacement (^, space, exp <-> x) more DRY-ly.
* implement extended rule for an OPEN range of integration
* given a single number, compute closest root (with ability to avoid specified roots), using inverse parabolic interpolation.
* given a single number, compute closest local max or min (w/ability to avoid specified ones?)
